Bug Report Title:
Accessing General settings form Admin settings does not display disabled submenus

Bug Report Issue:
#### Software and hardware versions 
Collect v1.20.0, Android v9 build number 00WW_5_140, device used Nokia 8 TA-1004

#### Problem description
Accessing General settings from Admin settings does not display all General settings submenus if access to them has been revoked from normal users.

When normal user access for all settings has been disabled, only the following submenu items are available in admin mode:
1. Server Settings -> ODK Aggregate settings
2. Form management -> Form filling -> Show guidance for questions

#### Steps to reproduce the problem

1. In Admin Settings -> User Settings, uncheck all check boxes
2. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> Server
3. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> User interface
4. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> Form management
5. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> User and device identity

#### Expected behavior
Accessing General settings via the Admin settings should allow access to all the settings in General settings submenus.

#### Other information 
Class `org.odk.collect.android.preferences.DisabledPreferencesRemover` does not seem to take into account whether the user is in admin mode or not. 

Class `org.odk.collect.android.preferences.GeneralPreferencesFragment` handles admin mode correctly for main General settings categories.

I'm working on a slightly diverged Collect fork where this issue is solved by handing  the boolean variable indicating admin access down to the submenu fragments. I've added the following lines [here](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/blob/4d476b6f7a63f225f9cb0a6812f5501ac81fc6f5/collect_app/src/main/java/org/odk/collect/android/preferences/GeneralPreferencesFragment.java#L82):

`Bundle bundle = new Bundle();`
`bundle.putBoolean(INTENT_KEY_ADMIN_MODE, getArguments().getBoolean(INTENT_KEY_ADMIN_MODE));`
`fragment.setArguments(bundle);`

Without this change the submenu fragments are always called without arguments including admin mode by [this](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/blob/4d476b6f7a63f225f9cb0a6812f5501ac81fc6f5/collect_app/src/main/java/org/odk/collect/android/preferences/GeneralPreferencesFragment.java#L87) method call.

Please feel free to use this approach @ajwad-shaikh unless you've already found another solution.

@lognaturel @shobhitagarwal1612 This is an important issue raised by @jsoppela 
Admins were unable to access the restricted settings to normal users. This creates a vulnerability in the workflow. Request you to put this up within the v1.21 milestone. 
Would be glad if one of you could take time out to review this PR
