The cover and show notes of the playing podcast disappear when I rotate the phone and the screen orientation switches from Portrait to Landscape or vice versa. Only when I go back to the playlist and then reopen the detail page the information will reappear.

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Open the detail view of the currently playing podcast
2. Rotate the phone (regardless of switching from Landscape to Portrait or from Portrait to Landscape)
3. Notice that the podcast cover and the show notes are gone

Comment#2:
I'd suggest reopen the issue. 

Based on the review done in PR #3006 so far, the fix is incomplete, and possibly introduces other bugs.

Nice to hear that you want to contribute. Please have a look at the comments and code in #3006 when starting to work on this. The issue was partially fixed but that pull request introduces new bugs.

Seems like this issue has been fixed on the development branch. I am unable to recreate it on the debug version of the app on the develop branch. This issue however does still exist in the released version.

I worked on the master branch's code and here is what I found:

-    The issue does get fixed when ``` setupGUI() ``` is placed in ```onCreate()``` of ```MediaPlayerActivity```. However, it can also be fixed by having ```setupGUI()``` in ```onStart()```. The actual fix comes from setting ```setRetainInstance(true)``` in the Fragment class. This is because when the activity is destroyed and created again during rotation, the ```ViewPager``` does not return a new instance of the ```CoverFragment``` which results it in being ```null```. This also explains why the cover art reappears when you scroll to the last (episode list) page on the ```ViewPager```. This is a known issue in ```ViewPager``` and so far, none of the workarounds have worked for me on this app.

-    When ```setupGUI()``` is placed in ```onCreate()``` of ```MediaPlayerActivity```, it does introduce a new bug. When you minimise the app and change the audio track from the notification and then reload the acitivity, sometimes, the cover does not update. This happens because ```onCreate()``` is not being called. I tried to fix this by putting ```setupGUI()``` in ```onStart()```, and, while ```onStart()``` is always called, seems that the system decides to not call ```setupGUI()```. This is weird, and I'm trying to understand why is this happening.

For now though, should I make a pull request for a hotfix on the master branch's code, or work on the develop branch and fix the new bug that I discovererd?

We are only working on the develop branch, there is no hotfix needed for master. It was partially fixed in #3006 but, as you said, there are some problems when moving setupGui to onCreate. #3006 mentions more problems (when the app was in background for a really long time, Android recreates the fragment even though setRetainInstance was called).

@m-Bilal you can look at https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/3006#issuecomment-459992864 on my feedback on the issue.

I've taken all my cues for debugging from #3006 (that comment mostly). I'll test the app more and let you guys know if I find anything else that's abnormal. For now, it's only the refreshing of the cover art that remains a problem.

Also, I've got exams coming up this week, so I'll resume my work from Saturday.

@m-Bilal Okay - Good luck with your exams!

@ByteHamster @orionlee
I am so sorry to be updating you guys this late, but I wasn't able to fix the bug for this long time. That single bug was causing a lot of unexpected behaviour (cover not changing when the track changed, and similar issues). I have fixed the bug now and the subsequent issues that resulted from it. You might find the fix to be a tad bit inefficient, but it was the only way to get it to work. Please review the pull request #3072 and let me know if there is anything that is to be changed.
