Bug Report Title:
Issue editing fishing spots

Bug Report Issue:
_From @cohenadair on July 6, 2016 15:38_

Trying to edit fishing spots adds a new one to the list, and the coordinates of the existing fishing spot are not updated.

Reproduction steps:
1. Edit a Location
2. Click a fishing spot to edit
3. Change the coordinates
4. Save
5. There will be two of the same spot showing in the list
6. Clicking save again will no add the addition spot (this behaviour is correct)
