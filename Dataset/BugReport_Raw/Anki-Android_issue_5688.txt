I think this should be easy based on what I know - my guess is that the Previewer is not correctly saving and reloading it's state in onSaveInstance/onCreate - as it is an Activity and those are actually destroyed / recreated in response to configuration changes. Might be as simple as just adding the current page number as another item that goes in and out of the bundle in that process
