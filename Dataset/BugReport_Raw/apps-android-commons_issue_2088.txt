Hey!!
Have you made any changes to your code. My app crashes while trying to open this activity. It gives null pointer exception.

java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity android.support.v4.app.Fragment.getActivity()' on a null object reference
        at fr.free.nrw.commons.media.MediaDetailPagerFragment$MediaDetailAdapter.getItem(MediaDetailPagerFragment.java:401)

@vanshikaarora I think that's unrelated. I fixed that in 46db38b8e902b4f81333ea54de41f861407c0e3c
