Bug Report Title:
Pressing Paint in Quiz mode crashes the app every time

Bug Report Issue:
No idea why, but it happens every time:

- tap More on any database (e.g. french-body-parts.db)
- select Quiz
- select some cards and press Start
- select Paint in menu
- crash

Paint works fine from Study mode (although I didn't see any way to clear the screen). App version: 10.10.1.

Comment#1:
Thank you for reporting the bug. I am able to reproduce the crash. I will fix it. 
There is a way to clear the screen, you can click the right of the top bar. There is a hidden tap target on the upper right of the screen. It must be a bug with the icon. I will also fix it.
