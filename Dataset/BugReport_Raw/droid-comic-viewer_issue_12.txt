Bug Report Title:
Crash on phones without Google Play

Bug Report Issue:
Steps to reproduce:
1. open Menu
2. select Settings
3. select About
4. select Google Play listing

On a phone without Google Play Store, this would cause a crash.
You may catch the exception, and then use this type of url to show the product on google play:
http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=<package_name>

On phones sold on some markets, the Google Services are not present, so this may be a serious problem.
