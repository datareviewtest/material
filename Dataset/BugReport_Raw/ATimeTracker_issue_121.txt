Same here, that happens only for entries on top of the list, the menu is actually scrollable (but nevertheless not quite usable), for entries further down the list (seems as soon as the menu height offset is reached) the entire menu is shown.

erAck: thanks for the info. I didn't realize the menu is scrollable. Good workaround for the time being ðŸ™‚

Seems to be an issue with Android 7 and later for unknown reasons.
On Android 7 only some of the entries are shown in the menu, but it is scrollable so the other can be accessed.
On Android 6 it works as before.
