Bug Report Title:
Fragment injection does not occur. NullPointerException for Android versions 22 (Lollipop 5.1) and below.

Bug Report Issue:
## Crash

The following crash occurs on devices running API 22 (Lollipop 5.1) and below.

```
   java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke interface method 'void com.vestrel00.daggerbutterknifemvp.ui.main.view.MainFragmentListener.onExample1Clicked()' on a null object reference
       at com.vestrel00.daggerbutterknifemvp.ui.main.view.MainFragment.onExample1Clicked(MainFragment.java:63)
      ...
```

The crash does not occur for API 23 (Marshmallow 6.0) and above.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the app
2. Click on Example 1 button

Observe the crash. Note that clicking on any of the example buttons will cause the crash.

## Analysis

The issue is that the `MainFragmentListener listener` in `MainFragment` is null for some reason. This suggests a bug with Dagger 2.11. 

The issue is that the injection is currently happening in [onAttach(Context)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html#onAttach(android.content.Context)), which is added in API level 23. This means that API level 22 and below will not invoke `onAttach(Context)`, thereby bypassing the injection. 

## Solutions

1. Perform fragment injection in [onAttach(Activity)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html#onAttach(android.app.Activity)).
2. Use AppCompat Activity and support Fragment with *dagger.android.support* injection frameworks.
