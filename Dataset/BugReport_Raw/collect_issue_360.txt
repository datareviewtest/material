Comment#1:
Looks like it's the same issue https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/issues/289 but now it occurs when we use the apk from Google Play.

The stack traces don't appear to have any useful info. Listing from the drive:

Publishing a previously loaded form:

@grzesiek2010 is probably correct that it's some kind of API auth issue like in #289 (the stack traces are also similar). @yanokwa and @mitchellsundt are working on it.

Comment#3:
Realized it couldn't be an API config issue since 1.4.12 and 1.4.13 are signed with the same key. It turns out it's a minification issue. Hints were that I couldn't generate a signed apk that worked when checking out 1.4.12 (minification was disabled for the release build but that code wasn't checked in) and the strange identifiers such as `org.odk.collect.android.h.g.a`. I'm going to turn minification off, add a comment saying why and check that change in.

@mapland thank you so much for reporting this immediately and providing details on what you tried.

Thanks Dream Team, seriously rapid repair, we are using Collect 1.4.14 off
Play and it is working smoothly.
