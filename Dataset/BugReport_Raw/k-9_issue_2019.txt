If you reported the crash via the reporter (which should have appeared if you installed the app via Google Play) then we should get a proper crash report and we'll get to it.

If not then we need a debug log &/or much more detailed reproduction steps - it doesn't seem to be reproducible just by doing a simple search.

There's nothing more we can do with this report. If there's a separate Google Play report with a new problem @cketti can raise it. If it's just #1240 then it's an issue with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (and possibly other devices) and we'll fix it under that issue.
