Bug Report Title:
Dark mode not correctly setting theme colors in card area of Reviewer

Bug Report Issue:
###### Reproduction Steps

Switch on Night Mode. 
It doesn't matter if one sets the Theme to "Dark" or "Black". 
Card background is always 100% black.

Pure black backgrounds [should be avoided](http://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/) from an UX perspective. It increases eyestrain and decreases legibility. 

I suggest that the card background should be toned down a bit.

Comment#1:
Ah, I see what you mean. The "dark" (vs "Black") setting doesn't affect card background while it does affect the other areas. 

I just poked around in the area and I think #5128 fixes it assuming it passes review
