## Issue Type
When I access the "More Samples" feature in the app and open the "Layout" section and click on the "Map in aview pager", the application suddenly refused to  run  and then the app becomes not responding so it asks to exit forcibly. And the same thing happened when I clicked on "Map in recycler / cardview layout".

## Description and/or steps/code to reproduce the problem
Install and open the app
then click "More Samples" and click on "Layout"
Next click on the "Map in a view Pager" feature and also "Map in a recycler / cardview Layout"
Then you will find the error as I experienced.
