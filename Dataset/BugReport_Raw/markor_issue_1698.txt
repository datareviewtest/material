Hmmm. The dialog ought to just dismiss on rotate. 

Also: You're running Android 8 on a pixel 4? (Or is this just the emulator?)

hi, it's just emulator(Android 8, pixel 4).

The dialog box did dissolve while rotating, but when rotating back, it reappeared and crashed due to the subsequent operation.

Comment#3:
The dialog is dismissed on rotation in current release (2.9.0). So this is obsolete.
