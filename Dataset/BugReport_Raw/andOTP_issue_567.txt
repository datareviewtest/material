Bug Report Title:
Switching language is not working.

Bug Report Issue:
#### General information

* **App version:** 0.7.1.1
* **App source:** GitHub

#### Expected result
**What is expected?** 
When switching language, the UI should display the right language

**What does happen instead?**

The app is falling back to english

#### Steps to reproduce
 
I think that the app should use `values-ar` `values-fr` etc instead of the regionalized `values-rLangRegion`
