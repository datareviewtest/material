Comment#1:
I added a PR that mirrors password visibility between the "new password" and "confirm" fields. I noticed that we don't have a TextInputLayout surrounding the confirm EditText (to show "Confirm password" above the EditText, like how "Enter new password" is shown above the new password EditText). If you'd like that to be added let me know and I can add it in, there shouldn't have to be any extra translations since the "Confirm password" String resource already exists (settings_hint_password_confirm).
