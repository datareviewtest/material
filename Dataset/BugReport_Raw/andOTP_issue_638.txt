Bug Report Title:
Confirmation field in settings doesn't react to show password option

Bug Report Issue:
#### General information

* **App version:** master
* **App source:** GitHub
* **Android Version:** 29
* **Custom ROM:** None (emulator)

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Open app.
1. Open Settings.
1. Tap "Authentication" to open dialog.
1. Enter new PIN/Password into both fields, and tap the "password visibility" option

#### Expected result

**What is expected?** 
Password/PIN shows in both fields

**What does happen instead?**
Password/PIN shows only in the main field, not the confirm field.

I added a similar fix for #580 for the introductory Password/PIN setting, so I'll port that over here as well.
