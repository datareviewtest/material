Bug Report Title:
Crash when backPress from SettingsActivity after Orientation changed

Bug Report Issue:
### DESCRIPTION

QKSMS crashes when pressing Back button from Settings Activity after Orientation change.
This bug happens both in version on Google Play and built from Github.
It only happens when rotating screen in Category (Appearance, General, Notifications, MMS, QK Reply, etc. ) of Settings.
### STEPS
1. Start QKSMS
2. Go to Settings by clicking on the OptionMenu -> Settings
3. Click on one Category in the list
4. When you are in the Category (for example, **General**), rotate the screen
5. After screen rotation, it will return to main Settings screen automatically (which is also not good)
6. Click on Back button
### EXPECTED

Return to the Conversations Activity which contains the conversation list.
### OBSERVATIONS

Crashes.
### Logcat from Android Studio

Comment#1:
I create a patch which corrects this issue (also the bad behavior : After screen rotation, it will return to main Settings screen automatically).

Please try it and decide what to do about this issue. Maybe you can come out with a better solution.

Thank you very much. I love QKSMS. It is great!

PS: Github does not permit to attach patch file, so I rename it with addition of ".txt" in the end.
