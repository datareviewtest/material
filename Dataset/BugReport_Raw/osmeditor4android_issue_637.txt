Bug Report Title:
Validator preferences causes crashing of app

Bug Report Issue:
## Vespucci Version
Vespucci 0.9.10b1324

## Device (Manufacturer and Model)
Samsung Galaxy A3 (SM-A300FU)

## Android Version 
Android 6.0.1

## Behaviour/Symptoms/Expected Behaviour/How to recreate
1. Remove all entries from Validator preferences except one re-survey entry
2. Set key "shop" and value to "*", max. age to "0" 
3. Press DONE and go back to the main screen.
3. The app immediately crashes when there are already downloaded data. If not, try to download view and the app crashes.

Next time, just visit Validator preferences and leave it without saving, just go back to the map and it crashes as well. Even removing of the entry doesn't solve the problem, you have to reset the app after that.

Comment#1:
Yes there is an issue when either of the lists is empty. Workaround: leave a dummy entry in both (one that wont match).

Comment#5:
And I'd like to point out that Value label overflows to the input element when using Czech language.
I know, it's another bug, I'm lazy to create new ticket.
