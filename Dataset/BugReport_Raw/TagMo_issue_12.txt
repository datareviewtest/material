Comment#1:
Is this log corresponding to my version ? I can't reproduce the issue

Comment#2:
Same on Galaxy s4. Does it require root? 
Edit: Nevermind, I fixed it commenting out all the ImageView parts inthe xml and in the code. I suggest you replace it with a basic shape since it causes issues to everybody apparently.

Comment#3:
I got it to work by changing the shapes like @Kidel mentioned

Comment#4:
Where can I find the xml file I need to comment out I have the same issue. 
---
Comment#5:
I fixed it in my fork and @azsde 's fork

Comment#6:
I can't compile it, and I thought you said you weren't allowed to distribute the .apk ?

If that's the case then the issue needs to be sorted on the official master ?

I hope the creator makes this fix soon.

Just wondering, what the wolf link editor is ( if its to increase items/ treasure i would like to do it) is there a link to more info?

I saw your message to somone else and going to have a go at making my own .apk from the source so i have the edit wolf function too.

As far as I know by default the Wolf Link Amiibo gives you an in game wolf with 3 hearts. If you also have Zelda TP on Wii U however you can write your save to the amiibo in order to powerup the wolf. 
However you can already find the .bin with everything maxed out. Just search  Wolf Link (20 Hearts, Cave of Shadows Beaten, B40), the bin should be around the first results.

Comment#14:
Hmm not quite, 5gb download, then update to latest version, then install all the repos required all to compile  a 1.3mb apk :-/

But it's done lol.

I am closing this issue now, if any new problems occur just open a new issue thread.
