Sir, I need help in building kiwix-android

I am getting this error everytime I try to run `kiwix-build kiwix-android`
```
The target platform android cannot be build on host Darwin.
Select another target platform or change your host system.

I am building the app but every time I am getting a web view app. Not the app available on play store.

Comment#9:
Have you changed the build variant to `kiwixDebug`?
Also, the app on the play store is the older version. We have added many new features which are yet to be released.

@abdulwd Got it. my mistake, I misunderstood the new app as a web app. It looks like a browser but it is notðŸ˜­. I did not find the option read aloud in this version.

Not showing any file for download in the online tab.

Comment#15:
There must be a loading icon, the files are dynamically fetched so it takes some time. You have to wait after opening the online tab and don't close it.

Comment#16:
Read Aloud is not present when no Zim File has been selected. Issue likely fixed in 3.0 some time ago.
Thank you for your report @XDivergent , closing
