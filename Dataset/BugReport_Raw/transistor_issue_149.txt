Comment#4:
Thanks. I cannot reproduce a crash on my device. But the Transistor UI becomes unresponsive when I rapidly tap on the play button. I guess your crash and the unresponsive UI are caused by the same problem. I think I know what to do change that.

Comment#5:
Transistor got a new user interface (see [v3.0.0](https://github.com/y20k/transistor/releases/tag/v3.0.0)). The old player screen is gone. So I guess I can close this issue for now. It is possible though that the new ui is plagued with the same bug. I cannot test it because the crash was not reproducible on my phone. :-( Sorry.
