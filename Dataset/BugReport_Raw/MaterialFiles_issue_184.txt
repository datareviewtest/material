Cannot reproduce on Android 9.0. When you "Close application", do you mean pressing back until back to home screen?

I mean pressing the "show open windows/apps" button and removing _Material Files_ window from the screen (so closing the app).

BTW, right now, I can't find _Material Files_ (which I uninstalled yesterday for precaution) in the F-Droid apps-list in my phone neither in the website version[1]. As if it has been removed?

Thanks a lot, best regards.

Ah, I can also reproduce it now. This is unexpected, I'll take a look later.

Regarding F-Droid, it's not removed because you can still visit its page at https://f-droid.org/packages/me.zhanghai.android.files (web version works). Someone told me that metadata for it is somehow broken but I'm not sure why... https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/issues/1865#note_250484892
