@misaochan I plan to ask for user permission and then the activity will finish. When the user will again start the upload from gallery it will work as expected and the upload will begin. Is this ok?

Comment#7:
Can you not proceed with the upload after permission is granted?

Comment#8:
@misaochan Ok i will try to do that but i am not sure about how to do it.

Is this issue still open, although I could see the dialog to ask for permissions when sharing multiple images from gallery, the negative cases where the user chooses deny is not handled, we can may be show him a dialog to let him know why we need the permission, and then prompt him again. Also if I choose deny (never ask again), I could see that that now sharing through gallery shows nothing (actually the activity's  finish()) is called, which appears to the user as if the app has crashed. My suggestion was to handle negative cases over here and maybe show appropriate dialogs wherever required so that the user might understand and actually give us the permissions.

@ashishkumar468 Sounds like a good plan, and indeed this would work well with #1773 .

@VaishSiddharth Have you made any progress on this just yet? If not, would you mind us assigning this task to AshishKumar? As I notice that you currently have a few tasks that you are already working on. :)
