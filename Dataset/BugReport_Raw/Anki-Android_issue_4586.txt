Bug Report Title:
Crash on add picture from camera on Android 7

Bug Report Issue:
Seems like a similar permissions issue to the crash when emailing apkgs that I recently fixed

```
android.os.FileUriExposedException: file:///storage/emulated/0/Pictures/img_201702162214361518016482.jpg exposed beyond app through ClipData.Item.getUri()
```
