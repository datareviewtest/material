While adding a new event for your contacts you can also set profile pictures to your contacts from your gallery or from your camera.

Thanks for opening this issue @iamank1t.

I can confirm that the issue exists, but I haven't had the time yet. I'll pick it up as soon as I'm done with the version I am working on, or hopefully someone else might pick it up ðŸ˜„

Sorry this took for ever, but a fix is coming in #188 

I'm closing this and hopefully the next update from the Playstore won't have the issue :)
