Confirmed, this happened on my device to.

Comment#2:
The only situation I found where the app crashes was if the backup could not be read. This could happen if the backup was never created, the device does not have an SD-card or the file could not be read for any other reasons.
I have added a check for if the file exists before attempting a restoration as well as displaying an error message for any other error.
Please, re-open if the issue remains after this fix.
