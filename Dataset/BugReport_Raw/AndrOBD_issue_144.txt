Bug Report Title:
[Bug] No Activity found in Bitcoin option

Bug Report Issue:
**Describe the bug**
When I want to donate the project in the setting page, it shows "No activity found to handle intent"

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to settings
2. Click support project (either paypal or bitcoin)
3. Pops up an error message "No activity found to handle intent"

I am not sure if I explained the reproduce steps clearly. So I made a bug gif as follows:

**Expected behavior**
A paypal or bitcoin donating page should be displayed.

**Important details on your environment:**

The link / intent ist supposed to start your bitcoin wallet app.
You will get this message only if you have NO bitcoin wallet installed on your device.

Which means, that someone who would donate, can't donate it if they can't see the address.
The Bitcoin option should at least show the bitcoin address so users can see/copy what address to donate to... or else it's the only option if you have the wallet app installed.
Or have a drop-down menu on Bitcoin option that displays the number or other options, like See number, copy number...
Or Instead of nothing, show a text "No Bitcoin Wallet installed", so here's the Address: ... ... ... ...
Currently in my opinion this is not a good app behaviour.

 @imaryandokani does your app literary flash white like in GIF ?

The thing is that this setting just plainly triggers a intent to open a URL (in this case a bitcoin://... URL)
This kind of intent does not have any specific error handling to be specified.

What I did now is:
- I added the plain text URL as descriptive text to these settings items, so it is at least readable from the settings.
