Comment#1:
It seems like downloadFragment.listView.invalidateViews();
doesn't know which orientation to move into. I'd like to work on this can anyone guide me? I am sort of a beginner to android.

@MisterAwesome23 The general way to go about fixing something like this is to first reproduce it on a device you have. Then get a stacktrace for it. Using this work out where the code is incorrect and attempt to change it so you no longer crash.

Comment#3:
What exactly is stack tracing. I performed the crash and noted the log cat for reason for crash that is from where I got the list view fragment function. Is there better ways to debug/stack trace or log cat is the right way.
I am pretty new to debugging too, any idea how to grap onto debugging quickly, like any course or resources?

Comment#4:
@MisterAwesome23 RE stacktracing yeah use you can use logcat. RE debugging its mostly something you just need to practise imo but there might be some good tutorials on Google.
