Bug Report Title:
Going back while recording sound causes endless loading (or crash)

> Record a sound
> record the sound 
> Don't press done, but go back (eg because the sound was not good and you want to re-record) 
> try to record a new sound
> press done
> get an endless Loading screen 
> unable to go back
> have to force close iNat app
> 
> Same issue if you have an existing observation 
> Record a sound, but don't press done, just go back to re-record. 
> Record the sound, press done, and endless Loading screen. 

Note that I believe she is using the built-in sound recorder. There are some large crash logs in slack: https://inaturalist.slack.com/archives/G041A2Z1W/p1571388239011300

When I try to replicate given the steps above (on a Pixel 3), I just get a crash immediately after tapping the back button in the left side of the header.

Comment#1:
The version of this bug that I was able to replicate seems fixed. Wish I'd written down where this original report came from...
